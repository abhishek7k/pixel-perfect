## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get PixelPerfect running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8+** (Python 3.10 or 3.11 recommended)
* **Git** (if cloning the repository)

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/PixelPerfect.git](https://github.com/yourusername/PixelPerfect.git) # Replace with your repo URL
    cd PixelPerfect
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install project dependencies:**
    This will install Streamlit, Pillow, OpenCV, Real-ESRGAN, rembg, and all other necessary libraries.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    **Important Note for GPU (NVIDIA CUDA) Users:**
    If you have an NVIDIA GPU and want to leverage it for faster AI enhancement (highly recommended for performance), you might need to install `torch` and `torchvision` with CUDA support **manually** after the above step, as `requirements.txt` might default to CPU versions.
    * First, deactivate your `venv` (`deactivate`), then reactivate.
    * Uninstall existing `torch` and `torchvision` if any:
        ```bash
        pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
        ```
    * Visit [PyTorch's official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and copy the `pip` command specific to your CUDA version (e.g., `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`).
    * After installing PyTorch with CUDA, you might need to reinstall `realesrgan`: `pip install realesrgan`.

4.  **Download AI Models (Automatic):**
    The necessary Real-ESRGAN (`weights/RealESRGAN_x4plus.pth`) and `rembg` models will be downloaded automatically the first time you run the application and use their respective features. Ensure you have an active internet connection for the first run.

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your default web browser should open a new tab with the PixelPerfect application (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

## üöÄ Usage

1.  **Upload Image(s):** Use the "Upload one or more images" button in the sidebar.
    * For **single image** editing, upload one file.
    * For **batch processing**, upload multiple files.
2.  **Select a Feature Tab:** Navigate through the tabs in the main content area (e.g., "Image Enhancement," "Image Compression," "Basic Image Forensics").
3.  **Adjust Parameters:** Use sliders, dropdowns, and input fields to configure the desired operation.
4.  **Apply Operation:** Click the "Apply" or "Generate" button within the tab.
5.  **View Results:** The "Processed Image" panel (right side) will update to show the result. For forensic tools like ELA, it will display the analysis output.
6.  **History:** Use "Undo," "Redo," and "Restore to Original" buttons in the sidebar to manage your editing history (for single images).
7.  **Download:**
    * For **single processed images or forensic results**, select your desired format in the sidebar "Download Options" and click "Download Current Image."
    * For **batch processed images**, a dedicated "Download All [X] Images (ZIP)" button will appear within the feature tab after processing is complete.
